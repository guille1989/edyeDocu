# Edye Documentation

The technical documentation for **Edye** consolidates all the information needed to understand, develop, maintain, and operate the technological ecosystem that supports the platform. Its goal is to provide a centralized, up-to-date, and structured reference that facilitates the work of the **development, DevOps, operations, QA, product, and integration** teams.

Edye is a system composed of multiple services, applications, APIs, and tools that interact to deliver a stable, secure, and scalable digital experience. Due to the distributed nature of the ecosystem and the continuous evolution of its components, this documentation serves as the single source of truth to:

- Understand the overall architecture and its main flows.  
- Learn the DevOps processes and standards applied in the organization.  
- Access usage, deployment, and operation manuals for each service.  
- Review how APIs, integrations, and pipelines work.  
- Ensure traceability and consistency across areas and regions.  

The information presented here follows a modular and practical structure, allowing navigation through specific sections based on the user’s role and needs. Each document is part of a unified technical framework that aims to improve collaboration among teams, accelerate delivery cycles, and ensure software quality at every stage.

This documentation is a living resource: it evolves alongside Edye’s platform, processes, and technologies. Therefore, any significant change in code, infrastructure, or operating models must be reflected here to maintain an accurate and up-to-date view of the entire ecosystem.
